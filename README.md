It provided the knowledge needed to tackle complex problems using machine learning. It provides basic natural language processing (NLP) concepts, data cleaning and vectorization techniques, and then takes a deep dive into building machine learning classifiers. It also shows how to build two different types of machine learning models, as well as how to evaluate and test variations of those models.
