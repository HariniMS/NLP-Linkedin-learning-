Hee...\\nham\\nThe last thing i ever wanted to do was hurt you. And i didn\\'t think it would have. You\\'d laugh, be embarassed, delete the tag and keep going. But as far as i knew, it wasn\\'t even up. The fact that you even felt like i would do it to hurt you shows you really don\\'t know me at all. It was messy wednesday, but it wasn\\'t bad. The problem i have with it is you HAVE the time to clean it, but you choose not to. You skype, you take pictures, you sleep, you want to go out. I don\\'t mind a few things here and there, but when you don\\'t make the bed, when you throw laundry on top of it, when i can\\'t have a friend in the house because i\\'m embarassed that there\\'s underwear and bras strewn on the bed, pillows on the floor, that\\'s something else.
